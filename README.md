# imagetracer.py 0.4
This is Experiment version,Work in progress,  
It based on Imagetracer.js 1.2.6  
https://github.com/jankovicsandras/imagetracerjs

Writtern by Python3,and It is not dependent to Node.js.  
But it's not a complete port yet.  
So,it is not suitable for practical use yet.  

Don't use this too large image larger than 1024x1024px.(30sec in my old 2014 machine)  
Recommend image size: smaller than 756ï½˜756 pixels 
A simple image of about 512x512 takes about 5-7 sec
  
It is nessesary import Pillow and addict library
